Firefox OS App tutorial for UK Postal Code 

This app gives you information on Postal Code (Zipcodes) of United Kingdom!

The App is just one screen. It takes an Indian Pincode (also known as Zipcode) and gives the details of the Pincode i.e. District, State, etc.

The application gets the data via an External API available at http://uk-postcodes.com
